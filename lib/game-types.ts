  intelligence: "You can use tools, you have culture",
  audacity: "Bold, risk tolerant, ex. colonizing new habitats",
  nocturnal: "Heat resistance, easy prey and excellent vision",
  acuteSense: "Sensitive to sound, taste, touch, smell; strong vision",

  sociability: "Cooperates with its own species, pack and social behavior",

  // Plant stats
  photosynthesis: "Plants harness energy from the sun",
  succulence: "Drought resistance, how much water can you hold?",
  spinescence: "You have a dense spine but lack flexibility, if you're not strong enough you may break in the wind",
  flexibility: "Ability to bend without breaking",
  hairiness:
    "You have 'trichomes'; can help avoid sun and wind damage, naturally insect repellant...unless the insect is a mite",
  waxiness: "Helps retain moisture in drought and repel excess water in tropical climates",
  height: "How close are you to your source of energy, the sun?",
  perennial: "Slow to mature and hardy, it takes more than a harsh winter to kill you",
  biennial: "You live fast but take a bit longer to matureâ€“this plant completes its life cycle in 2 years",
  annual: "Live fast and die young! This plant completes its entire life cycle in 1 year",

  // Fungi stats
  decomposer: "Fungi metabolize dead matter, one organism's trash is another's treasure",
  parasitic: "You like a live meal, nematodes and athletes' feet beware",
  symbiotic: "You work with another species and both get what you need, mutualism",
  perfect: "You can reproduce asexually and sexually",
  imperfect: "You can reproduce asexually only",
  toxic: "Can keep you safe from herbivores and enthusiasts",
  unicellular: "You're a yeast cell!",
  multicellular: "Complex",
  aerobic: "You need oxygen to survive",
  anaerobic: "You do not need oxygen to survive",

  // Protist stats
  aquatic: "You need moisture to survive",
  flagella: "Like a tail, but for a microscopic eukaryotic",
  cilia: "Like a flagella except short and covering the entire organism",
  pseudopod: "'False feet' of amoeba-types, extensions of cytoplasm used for movement",
  ingestor: "You engulf bacteria and the like for food",
  absorptive: "You diffuse molecules in for food",
  photosynthetic: "You need light for food",

  // Bacteria stats
  mutation: "Your life cycle and reproduction process lends itself to mutations and highly adaptive populations",
  horizontalGeneTransfer: "You share genetic mutations and advantageous traits within and between species",
  pathogenic: "You're part of a minority of the kingdom that thrive on other organisms' suffering",
  beneficial: "You inhabit the world around less offensively, sometimes you even help organisms out",
  antibioticResistance: "What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger",
  parallelEvolution: "You were forged in the fires of your environment alone",
  coevolution: "You coevolved with another species of bacteria in a mutually beneficial way",

  // Archaea stats
  extremophile: "You can survive in intense environments",
  thermophilic:
    "Proteins have a prominent hydrophobic core and increased electrostatic interactions to maintain activity at high temps",
  psychrophilic:
    "Proteins have a reduced hydrophobic core and a less charged protein surface to maintain flexibility and activity in cold temps",
  halophilic: "Increased negative surface charge, which compensates for the extreme ionic conditions",
  acidophilic: "You survive in an extremely acidic environment",
  alkaliphilic: "You survive in an extremely basic environment",
  piezophilic: "Your optimal growth is under high hydrostatic pressure",
